    <h1>About Covid-19</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>1. What is Covid-19?</h2>
        <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses found mostly in animals.
          Coronavirus is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
          In humans, they can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe conditions such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
          The disease caused by the new coronavirus has been named COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>COVID-19 was first identified in late 2019.
          It was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.
        </p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>2. Effects</h2>
        <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
          Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses.
        </p>
        <p>Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.
           About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen, and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.
           Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.
           In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.

        <h2>5. When Should I Get Tested?</h2>
        <p>Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible.
          People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or maybe, infected may also consider testing
          – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.
          You may also take this <a href="https://bc.thrive.health">self-assessment tool</a>.
        </p>
        <p>While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others.
          Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care.facilities.
